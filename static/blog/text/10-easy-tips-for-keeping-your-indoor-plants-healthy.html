    <li>Choose the right plant for your space. Consider the lighting and temperature in your home and choose a plant that will thrive in those conditions.</li>
    
    <li>Water your plants correctly. Make sure to water your plants regularly, but avoid overwatering. Check the soil regularly and only water when it's dry.</li>
    
    <li>Use the right soil. Different plants require different types of soil. Make sure to choose the right soil for your plant to help it thrive.</li>
    
    <li>Provide adequate drainage. Make sure your plant has adequate drainage to avoid waterlogging the soil. Use a pot with drainage holes and a saucer to catch excess water.</li>

    <li>Clean your plants regularly. Dust and debris can accumulate on your plant's leaves, which can affect their health. Wipe down your plants' leaves regularly to keep them clean.</li>
    
    <li>Prune your plants as needed. Pruning can help your plants stay healthy and promote growth. Remove any dead or damaged leaves or stems as needed.</li>
    
    <li>Keep your plants away from drafts. Extreme temperature changes can be harmful to your plants. Keep them away from drafty windows or doors.</li>
    
    <li>Fertilize your plants. Indoor plants need nutrients to thrive. Use a fertilizer specifically designed for indoor plants to help them grow strong and healthy.</li>
